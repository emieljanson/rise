      <p>You’re probably as much used to a schedule as we do: we all grew up with rosters and plans. When to attend soccer practice? What time’s history class? When to turn in your writing assignment? Our time is defined by going from thing to thing. And by the time we get to our first job, <strong>we’re used to other people dictating our time.</strong></p>
      <p>Take a look at your calendar: how much of it is taken up by appointments with other people? <strong>No wonder so many people feel that they are unable to work on the things that are most important to them.</strong></p>
      <p>The solution is simple. Set aside blocks of time to work on things you care about. This is the way to make real progress. But guarding your time is really hard.</p>
      <p><strong>It’s time to fundamentally rethink how you decide how to spend the most valuable thing you have: your time.</strong></p>
