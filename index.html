      <h4 class="tagline">The Rise Calendar Manifesto</h4>
      <h1>Rise gives you clarity, direction and peace of mind. Got a minute?</h1>
      <p class="why">We’ve set out to build a next generation calendar by combining the best ideas from bestseller GRIP with world class and internationally praised design.</p>
      <p>We all have a thousand things we want in life. Meanwhile, people are pulling strings to get a slice of your time. And while time is easy to spend, it’s impossible to get extra. What’s gone is gone.</p>
      <p>And so after a busy day with work, calls and emails, it can be hard to answer the question: ‘what did you <em>really</em> do today?’</p>
      <p>As a fix, we’re using to-do lists to write down what we want. A to-do list is very patient. And its infinity is comforting: there’s time! Only later we find out that actually our time is limited.</p>
      <p>Very limited.</p>
      <p>A calendar is finite. And that’s why we believe the calendar is the perfect centerpiece for work and life. And because it’s as limiting as the real world, it forces us to decide how we spend the most valuable thing we have: our time.</p>
      <p>Rise is different than your current calendar, because instead of starting with meeting invites from others, it starts with you. Your goals, your projects, your work.</p>

      <h4 class="tagline">What a calendar should look like</h4>
    </div>

    <div id="principles">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <div style="background-image: url('img/icon1.svg'); background-color:rgba(244,182,102,0.25); background-size: 28px 26px; background-position: 12px 12px" class="image"></div>
          <h2>Your calendar should be the centerpiece of your work</h2>
          <p>Whatever is next on your plate, it should be on your schedule.</p>
          <p>Using your calendar for work is really powerful: it forces you to decide when a task will be worked on and it clearly communicates when you’re fully booked. This complete overview allows you to make better informed decisions about how you spend your time. Rise is a calendar and task manager in one.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div style="background-image: url('img/icon2.svg'); background-color:rgba(250,55,208,0.15); background-size: 26px 27px; background-position: 12px 9px" class="image"></div>
          <h2>Your calendar should help you have more uninterrupted time to do actual work</h2>
          <p>If you create stuff for a living, you can only do great work when you have long stretches of uninterrupted time.</p>
          <p>Rise will help you have more time, automatically.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div style="background-image: url('img/icon3.svg'); background-color:rgba(55,250,215,0.15); background-size: 24px 24px" class="image"></div>
          <h2>Your calendar should help you discover your ideal weekly rhythm</h2>
          <p>In a calendar, each hour and each day look the same. So it’s easy to assume that any time works for any activity. Which obviously is not true: if you’re a night owl, a brainstorming session at 9am on a Monday probably won’t work.</p>
          <p>We believe your calendar should help you figure out your ideal weekly rhythm, and help you make the most of it.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div style="background-image: url('img/icon4.svg'); background-color:rgba(250,55,190,0.15); background-size: 26px 26px" class="image"></div>
          <h2>Your calendar should help you set and complete goals</h2>
          <p>Setting goals forces you to think about what’s important. Your goals shape the way you spend your time. Or at least: they should.</p>
          <p>Rise will help you get into the habit of setting goals and we’ll make sure you don't lose sight of them.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <div style="background-image: url('img/icon5.png'); background-color:rgba(55,171,250,0.15); background-size: 26px 26px" class="image"></div>
          <h2>Your calendar should allow you to forget about time</h2>
          <p>You know how Presidents and executives manage to be fully present for the extent of a 30 minute meeting? They never spend time thinking about when to leave, what time it is or how long they have until the meeting ends.</p>
          <p>Rise won’t make you President, but it will make you more present. Your calendar should allow you to forget about time. It should make sure you start on time and get to the next meeting with a single click. If you have to travel between locations, it should monitor traffic. It should also warn you when time’s almost up, so you can let go of the clock and focus on what is in front of you.</p>
